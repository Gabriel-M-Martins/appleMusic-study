    "albumArtistDescription": "Melissa Viviane Jefferson (born April 27, 1988), known professionally as Lizzo, is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, and flutist. Born in Detroit, Michigan, she moved to Houston, Texas, where she began performing, before moving to Minneapolis, where she began her recording career. Before signing with Nice Life and Atlantic Records, Lizzo released two studio albums—Lizzobangers (2013), and Big Grrrl Small World (2015). Lizzo's first major-label EP, Coconut Oil, was released in 2016.\nShe attained mainstream success with the release of her third studio album, Cuz I Love You (2019), which peaked inside the top five of the US Billboard 200. The album spawned two singles: \"Juice\" and \"Tempo\". The deluxe version of the album included Lizzo's 2017 single \"Truth Hurts\", which became a viral sleeper hit, topping the US Billboard Hot 100 two years after its initial release. Around this time, her 2016 single \"Good as Hell\" also climbed the charts, reaching the top three on the Hot 100 and top ten of the UK Singles Chart. Lizzo received eight nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, the most for any artist that year, including Album of the Year for the deluxe version of Cuz I Love You, Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Truth Hurts\", as well as Best New Artist. She eventually won the awards for Best Urban Contemporary Album, Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Truth Hurts\", and Best Traditional R&B Performance for the song \"Jerome\".\nAside from singing and rapping, Lizzo also takes up acting roles: she served as a voice performer in the animated film UglyDolls (2019) and appeared in the crime comedy-drama film Hustlers (2019). In 2019, Time named Lizzo as \"Entertainer of the Year\" for her meteoric rise and contribution to music. In addition to her three Grammy Awards, she has also won a Billboard Music Award, a BET Award and two Soul Train Music Awards.",

    "albumDescription": "How to Be a Human Being is the second studio album by English indie rock group Glass Animals. It was released on 26 August 2016 by Wolf Tone and Caroline International in Europe, and Harvest Records in the United States. The album generally favourable reviews from music critics, who complimented its \"sense of wonder\" and \"immediate impression\", but felt it was somewhat premature. There are a total of 11 songs on the track listing, along with 11 characters illustrated on the cover art. Each song, along with its unique personality and quirks, represents a person on the album. The album was nominated for the 2017 Mercury Prize.",
    "albumArtistDescription": "Glass Animals are a British electronic/pop band formed in Oxford in 2010. Led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Bayley, the group also features his childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew MacFarlane. Bayley wrote and produced all three Glass Animals albums. The first, Zaba (2014), spawned the single \"Gooey\", which was eventually certified platinum in the United States. Their second full album, How to Be a Human Being, received generally positive reviews and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. The third, Dreamland, their first fully autobiographical album (Bayley had said he felt it was selfish to write about oneself), included the single \"Tokyo Drifting\" which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Glass Animals have become known for their live shows, where they play re-worked, dance-heavy versions of their songs. Their song \"Heat Waves\" reached number one in Australia in February 2021 and was voted number one on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020.",

    "albumDescription": "After Hours is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer the Weeknd, released on March 20, 2020, by XO and Republic Records. Primarily produced by the Weeknd, it features a variety of producers, including DaHeala, Illangelo, Max Martin, Metro Boomin, and OPN, most of whom the Weeknd had worked with previously. The standard edition of the album has no features, although the remixes edition contains guest appearances from Chromatics and Lil Uzi Vert. Thematically, After Hours explores promiscuity, overindulgence, and self-loathing.\nPrior to the album's release, the Weeknd confirmed that After Hours would face stylistic differences to its predecessor, Starboy (2016). Music journalists have noted the album as an artistic reinvention for the Weeknd, with the introduction of new wave and dream pop influences. The artwork and aesthetic for its promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as Casino (1995), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), and Uncut Gems (2019), while its title is borrowed from the 1985 film directed by Martin Scorsese.\nAfter Hours was supported by four singles: \"Heartless\", \"Blinding Lights\", \"In Your Eyes\", and \"Save Your Tears\", three of which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The title track was released as a promotional single. In March 2020, After Hours broke the record for the most global pre-adds in Apple Music history, with over 1.02 million users. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, with some naming it the Weeknd's best work. It debuted atop the Billboard 200, marking the Weeknd's fourth number-one album in the US, and stayed atop the chart for four consecutive weeks. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album double platinum. After Hours also reached the top spot in 20 other countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom. The Weeknd will embark on the After Hours Tour, which is set to span Europe and North America.",
    "albumArtistDescription": "Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer. Among the world's best selling musical artists with over 75 million records sold and on the list of most-streamed artists on Spotify, Tesfaye has won many accolades, including three Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, nineteen Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, nine Juno Awards, five SOCAN awards and one BRIT Award, and has been nominated for an Academy Award. He holds several chart records, being the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three positions on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart with \"Can't Feel My Face\", \"Earned It\", and \"The Hills\". In February 2015, he was awarded the Allan Slaight Award by Canada's Walk of Fame. In 2017, he was featured on the cover of Forbes for his annual earnings of $92 million. Elton John listed him as one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2020 in Time. Tesfaye has a notable voice with a soaring falsetto and its singular tremolo. He has influenced artists in many contemporary music styles including pop, hip hop, and rhythm and blues.\nTesfaye began his recording career in 2009, anonymously uploading \"Do It\" to YouTube. In 2011, he met Sal Slaiby, founder of SAL&CO and CP Group, and Amir Esmailian, with whom he founded XO Records. Under the record label, Tesfaye released his debut mixtapes House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, and quickly earned a following and critical recognition from several mainstream publications due to his dark style of Contemporary R&B and the mystique surrounding his identity. In 2012, he signed with Republic Records and re-released the mixtapes in the compilation album Trilogy (2012). His debut studio album, Kiss Land, was released in 2013. Beauty Behind the Madness (2015), with the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\", won Best Urban Contemporary Album and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2016 Grammy Awards and was among the best-selling albums of 2015.\nTesfaye's third album Starboy (2016) was a similar commercial success and included the number-one single of the same name, and also won Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2018 Grammy Awards. His fourth album, After Hours (2020), featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Heartless\", \"Save Your Tears\", and \"Blinding Lights\", the latter of which has since become the first ever song to spend over a year in the top ten of the chart and was the most streamed song on Spotify in 2020.\nHe chose his stage name in tribute to when he was 17 years old, when, along with a friend, he dropped out of high school, took his mattress, and \"left one weekend and never came home\". However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with Canadian band the Weekend.",

    "albumDescription": "Chromatica is the sixth studio album by American singer Lady Gaga, released on May 29, 2020, by Interscope Records and subsidiary Streamline. Gaga supervised the production with longtime collaborator BloodPop and a variety of producers to create a concept album returning to her dance-pop roots, eschewing the stripped-down style of its predecessors Joanne (2016) and A Star Is Born (2018). Chromatica draws inspiration from 1990s house music, seeing Gaga adopt a cyberpunk-inspired persona.\nThe album centers on ideas of unwavering happiness and the pursuit of healing. Songs on Chromatica encompass themes inspired by failed romance and mental health struggles in Gaga's private life. The music is distinguished by dense synthesizers, percussion, grooves, and orchestral arrangements that merge overarching melodies. Blackpink, Ariana Grande, and Elton John contribute guest vocals. Most of the recording took place at Henson Recording Studios and Gaga's in-home Hollywood Hills studio.\nInterscope advertised Chromatica through product endorsements and TV partnerships, part of a more aggressive marketing campaign adversely affected in the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Four singles supported the album, two of which reached the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100: the lead single \"Stupid Love\" reached number 5, whereas its follow-up, \"Rain on Me\" with Grande, topped the chart and garnered Gaga's fifth number-one song in the US.\nChromatica was well received by music critics; the craftsmaship and treatment of the subject matter were sources of praise in the reviews, though the house production drew more frequent criticism. At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Chromatica was a candidate for Best Pop Vocal Album, while \"Rain On Me\" made Gaga the first ever artist to win the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category at least twice. The album topped the charts in many overseas markets, and by selling 274,000 album-equivalent units in the United States, it debuted as Gaga's sixth consecutive number one album on the Billboard 200.",
    "albumArtistDescription": "Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (/ˈstɛfəni ˌdʒɜːrməˈnɒtə/ STEF-ən-ee JUR-mə-NOT-ə; born March 28, 1986), known professionally as Lady Gaga, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a career in music. After Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Akon's label, KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga rose to prominence the following year with her debut studio album, The Fame, and its chart-topping singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". The album was later reissued to include the EP The Fame Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles \"Bad Romance\", \"Telephone\", and \"Alejandro\".\nGaga's five succeeding studio albums all debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and sold more than one million copies in its first week. Its title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store, with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her EDM-influenced third album, Artpop (2013) and its lead single \"Applause\", Gaga released the jazz album Cheek to Cheek (2014) with Tony Bennett and the country pop and soft rock-influenced album Joanne (2016). She also ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–2016), for which she received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and the critically acclaimed musical drama film A Star Is Born (2018). Her contributions to the latter's soundtrack, which spawned the chart-topping single \"Shallow\", made her the first woman to win an Academy, Grammy, BAFTA, and Golden Globe Award in one year. Gaga returned to her dance-pop roots with her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020), which yielded the number-one single \"Rain on Me\".\nHaving sold 124 million records as of 2014, Gaga is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the fourth highest-earning female musician of the 2010s. Her achievements include 12 Grammy Awards, various Guinness World Records, awards from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and recognition as Billboard's Artist of the Year (2010) and Woman of the Year (2015). She has also been included in several Forbes' power rankings and was ranked fourth on VH1's Greatest Women in Music (2012). Time magazine named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010 and 2019, and placed her on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list. Her philanthropy and activism focus on mental health awareness and LGBT rights; in 2012, she founded the Born This Way Foundation, a non-profit organization aiming to empower youth, improve mental health, and prevent bullying. Gaga's business ventures include Haus Laboratories, a vegan cosmetics brand that launched in 2019.",

    "albumDescription": "Loud is the fifth studio album by Barbadian singer Rihanna. It was released on November 12, 2010, by Def Jam Recordings and SRP Records. The album was recorded between February and August 2010, during the singer's Last Girl on Earth tour and the filming of her first feature film Battleship (2012). Rihanna and L.A. Reid were the executive producers of Loud and worked with various record producers, including Stargate, Sandy Vee, The Runners, Tricky Stewart and Alex da Kid. The album features several guest vocalists, including rappers Drake, Nicki Minaj and Eminem, who is featured on the sequel to \"Love the Way You Lie\", titled \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\".\nA dance-pop and R&B album, Loud differs from Rihanna's previous record, Rated R (2009), which incorporates a prominently foreboding and angry tone and dark themes. Loud features up-tempo songs, and marks the return to dancehall; a genre prominent on her first two albums Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl like Me (2006). It also uses rock in \"California King Bed\" and reggae in the Caribbean-inspired \"Man Down\".\nLoud received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its upbeat material and Rihanna's vocal performances, while others stated that although the songs were solid, they were unfocused to each other. The album was a commercial success; it debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart, with sales of 207,000 copies, the highest first-week sales of her career at the time. The album peaked at number one on the Canadian, Swiss and the UK album charts. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Loud was the eighth global best-selling album of 2011. Since its release, it has sold over 8 million copies worldwide.\nThe album produced seven singles, including the international hits \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What's My Name?\", and \"S&M\". All three singles reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"S&M\" was Rihanna's tenth number one song in the US, making Rihanna the youngest recording artist to accumulate the plateau in the shortest time, surpassing Mariah Carey. \"Only Girl (In the World)\" won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in February 2011; additionally, the album was nominated for three more Grammy Awards, including for Album of the Year. To support the album, Rihanna embarked on her third worldwide concert tour, entitled the Loud Tour.",

    "albumDescription": "Talking Is Hard is the third studio album by American rock band Walk the Moon, released on December 2, 2014, by RCA Records. The band chose to work with Tim Pagnotta to produce an album that would explore different influences and sounds to differentiate it from their self-titled major label debut (2012). Described as an indie pop, new wave and pop record, the album takes inspiration from multiple artists of the 1980s.\nThree singles were released from Talking Is Hard, with the lead single \"Shut Up and Dance\" becoming Walk the Moon's biggest hit in the United States, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also an international hit for the band, reaching the top ten in multiple countries. The album is Walk the Moon's most commercially successful record to date, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard 200 and receiving a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).",
    "albumArtistDescription": "Walk the Moon (stylized as WALK THE MOON) is an American rock band based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Lead singer Nicholas Petricca started the band in 2006, while a student at Kenyon College, deriving the band's name from the song \"Walking on the Moon\" by the Police. The group independently released their debut studio album, I want! I want!, in November 2010, receiving airplay for the track \"Anna Sun\" on multiple alternative radio stations. Along with the success of \"Anna Sun\", Alt Nation named them a band you need to know for the summer of 2012. Influential music blog Neon Gold helped to break the band in January 2011, calling \"Anna Sun\", \"the kind of stuff British A&R dreams, and major label bidding wars, are made of.\"\nIn February 2011, Walk the Moon signed to RCA Records and in June 2012, released their first major label studio album, Walk the Moon. The album includes a re-recorded version of \"Anna Sun.\" In December 2014, the band released their second major-label studio album, Talking Is Hard. This album includes the song \"Shut Up and Dance\", which hit number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one on the Billboard Rock Songs chart and Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Ryan Seed of Billboard gave \"Shut Up and Dance\" four and a half stars out of five.\nThe band's latest album is 2017's What If Nothing, which peaked at #40 on the Billboard 200, and whose lead single \"One Foot\" peaked at #1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Three other singles were released from the album in 2018, and in 2019 several more stand-alone singles were released, with further plans to release a new album sometime in 2020.\nWalk the Moon have cited Talking Heads, David Bowie, the Police, Tears for Fears, and Phil Collins as influences. The band's use of 1980s musical mainstays, such as keyboard and synthesizer, is also notable. ",
